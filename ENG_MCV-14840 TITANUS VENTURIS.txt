### üöÄ Notes on **FTL Jump Range: Unlimited**

* Powered by the **Quantum Singularity Drives** (QSD), which do not require conventional fuel or charge cycles.
* The ship can theoretically **jump across the galaxy** ‚Äî subject only to **astrometric precision** and **gravitational turbulence near mass concentrations** (e.g. galactic core).
* **No cooldown** or **jump limit** per mission ‚Äî bounded only by **crew endurance** and **spatial navigational risk factors**.
